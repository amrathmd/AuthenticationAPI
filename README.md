# MERN Stack Application

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that consists of a client folder containing a React application and a server folder containing a Node.js backend application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/amrathmd/AuthenticationAPI.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4 or higher)

### Installing

To install the required dependencies for the client and server applications, navigate to the root directory(for both client and server seperately in the root dir) of the cloned repository and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies for both the client and server applications seperately.

### Running the Application

To start the development server for both the client and server applications, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and run:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the React development server and the Node.js server concurrently.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the React application in the browser.
